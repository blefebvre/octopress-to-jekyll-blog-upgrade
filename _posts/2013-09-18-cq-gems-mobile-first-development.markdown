I presented a talk on [Mobile First Development with CQ Made Easy](http://dev.day.com/content/ddc/en/gems/mobile-first-development-with-cq-made-easy0.html) as part of the [CQ Gems](http://dev.day.com/gems) technical series. My slides from CQCON were updated to include a more complete list of resources. 

Bonus: the source code of "CQCON Village" - the site I made responsive during the demo - is available on github including all the steps I went through to transform it.
